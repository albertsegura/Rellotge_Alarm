Rellotge_Alarm
==============

Arduino based clock alarm with Radio and LCD.

VERY UGLY CODE! My apologies. I will clean it as soon as I have time to re-take this project.

**Features:**

* Clock: Hour, day, month, year... Driven by interruptions.
* Alarm.
* LCD Screen
* Radio FM
* Possibility to store up to 8 stations
* EEPROM storage

**Improvements:**

* Replace the Clock interruptions with a 555 RTC timer to improve the acuracity.
